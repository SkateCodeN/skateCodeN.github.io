<h1>Hello World</h1>

<h2 class="headline">The start of something new July 19,2019</h2>
<p class="headline-body">I quit my Corporate IT job in the winter of 2018. <br>
    With the lack of tech jobs up here in the alpine lake of Tahoe, <br>
    I have turned to the idea of moving and applying to programming jobs.<br>
    However, there is a catch in this industry, professional experiece. <br>
    I have my professional background in IT and a degree in computer programming. <br>
    My hopes lie in the fact that this will become a portfolio page showcasing <br>
    my skill.
