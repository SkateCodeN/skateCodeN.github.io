<h1>Hello World</h1>

<h2 class="headline">The start of something new July 19,2019</h2>
<p class="headline-body">I quit my Corporate IT job in the winter of 2018. <br>
    With the lack of tech jobs up here in the alpine lake of Tahoe, <br>
    I have turned to the idea of moving and applying to programming jobs.<br>
    However, there is a catch in this industry, professional experiece. <br>
    I have my professional background in IT and a degree in computer programming. <br>
    My hopes lie in the fact that this will become a portfolio page showcasing <br>
    my skill.
</p>
<h2 class="july21-19"> July 21, 2019</h2>
<p> Today is the start of something promising, not only is the content of this site evolving, <br>
    my skills as a programmer are also becoming more fluid. Each day bring opportunity and confidense <br>
    in myself. Soon I hope to be utilizing my knowledge to create and assist teams in solving problems.<br>
    My dream has always been to be apart of something that contributes to making a small dent to mankind.<br>
    That dent I hope bears a positive outcome to society. 
</p>

    We are still making progress although its getting harder to get up early after 9 hours of physical
    labor. No matter my spirits are slowly lifting up. This weekend I am to go out into the woods for 
    camping so it will be a nice time to clear my head.

    We will see how it all goes. Will have to submit code on the go.

<h2 class="JulyCampingTrip"> My Camping Trip</h2>
<p>
    A lot was learned about the beauty of Humboldt County. The air is fresh and the trees can be quite
    gigantic. The Redwoods are definately a sight to see and I leave with the axiom: Hammocks over tents.
