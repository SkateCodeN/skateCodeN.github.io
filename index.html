<h1>Hello World</h1>

<h2 class="headline">The start of something new July 19,2019</h2>
<p class="headline-body">I quit my Corporate IT job in the winter of 2018. <br>
    With the lack of tech jobs up here in the alpine lake of Tahoe, <br>
    I have turned to the idea of moving and applying to programming jobs.<br>
    However, there is a catch in this industry, professional experiece. <br>
    I have my professional background in IT and a degree in computer programming. <br>
    My hopes lie in the fact that this will become a portfolio page showcasing <br>
    my skill.
</p>
<h2 class="july21-19"> July 21, 2019</h2>
<p> Today is the start of something promising, not only is the content of this site evolving, <br>
    my skills as a programmer are also becoming more fluid. Each day bring opportunity and confidense <br>
    in myself. Soon I hope to be utilizing my knowledge to create and assist teams in solving problems.<br>
    My dream has always been to be apart of something that contributes to making a small dent to mankind.<br>
    That dent I hope bears a positive outcome to society. 
</p>

    Used novoresume to create a new professional resume. I am hoping that with this website, chronicalling 
    all of my projects, and therefore holding me resposible for this website. 
</p>

<h2 class="july23-19"> July 23, 2019</h2>
<p> 
    We have to move thigs along on this website. It has writtten content, but it also needs pictures 
    and a dash of css. Plus one must consider how this website will present the content. 
</p>

    We are still making progress although its getting harder to get up early after 9 hours of physical
    labor. No matter my spirits are slowly lifting up. This weekend I am to go out into the woods for 
    camping so it will be a nice time to clear my head. 
</p>
<h2 class="july25-19"> July 25, 2019</h2>
<p>
    "We are in the money mr. Hat". This weekend I will be heading to N. California for a bit of camping.
    We will see how it all goes. Will have to submit code on the go. 
</p>
<h2 class="julyCampingTrip"> My Camping Trip</h2>
<p>
    A lot was learned about the beauty of Humboldt County. The air is fresh and the trees can be quite
    gigantic. The Redwoods are definately a sight to see and I leave with the axiom: Hammocks over tents.
</p>
<h2 class="july30-19">July 30, 2019</h2>
<p> I've definately have been learning more about the possibilities of employment and empowerment of 
    working as a programmer. Wether it be as a Web developer or software dev. I am in a great state 
    where anything is possible and I keep a positive view of the future. 

</p>
<h2 class="july31-19">July 31, 2019</h2>
<p>
    Waking up and coding has become a sort of reflex that I do everyday now. I am even addicted to 
    seeing the little gray squares light up in the github contribution calendar. So the journey continues.
    The question that comes to mind is, what is the end goal? I believe a nice job opportunity, where 
    my skills are directly being used to solve problems that are tangible with helping people. 
    I am doing this in the hopes that it establishes legitimacy in me calling myself a coder.

    I have completed the website for uncommonkitchen.org, it was a journey and presented it to 
    the owner. He was pleased and that makes me happy. He had a few suggestions for changes but they are 
    minor. I will be working on SEO to make sure each page has 100 score on lighthouse. I will then
    start to chart the progress as it will be a portfolio to showcase. 
</p>
<h2 class="august03-19">August 03, 2019</h2>
<p> I guess you could say that I started a gig as a assistant for a local real estate agent. 
    Its interesting to see the transition from corporate security net job to a more volataile "gig market". 
    I believe this momentum will continue. My goal is still to be remote and to travel. My current dream
    is still the same. To open my laptop and make money, to have knowledge, to travel and explore.
</p>
<h2 class="august06-19">august 06, 2019</h2>
<p> 
    It has been a little tough this past few days to update this page or my github. It is all because
    I have another client for my web development gig. This is a big project as we are elevating the 
    hosting platform to that of cloud infrastructure. There will be also new waters to tread as I Will
    be doing SEO.
</p>
<h2 class="august07-19">August 07,2019</h2>
<p> 
    We have arrived to the conclusion that AWS services will be used to host the new site. So I am 
    treding new waters. I will continue to write how this site goes.
</p>
<h2 class="august08-19">August 08, 2019</h2>
<p>
    The weeks of August are going by fast. My goal before this month is to have the website running, 
    and ready for Branden. After I finish the website for the client I plan to go full SEO. So this 
    is the rubrik that I am starting to do. We shall see how all of this plays out. I am interested in 
    gaining skills in SEO as well as AWS. 
</p>

    Drove down to the bay area, around San Jose to join a hackathon. The drive was great and the only
    qualm I have is this: the techies need to invest on their road infrastructure. So stay tuned to see 
    how this hackathon goes. Btw its a data science hackathon. Our dataset is on college student potential
    admission. 
</p>
<h2 class="august11-19">August 11,2019</h2>
<p> A lot was learned in the hackathon. It was an interesting feeling not knowing what the heck was 
    going on and little by little, one guide at a time I was able to understand the basics. One can 
    say that this is where my data science journey begins.
</p>
<h2 class="august13-19">August 13, 2019</h2>
<p>
    In the next coming days, I will piece together the new static website, with IDX listings from the MLS.
    This site will be hosted on AWS or Google cloud. I am still undicided. However, one thing is for square,
    now that I have clients and projects to back up my claim as a web dev. I need to work on my brand. 
    By that extension I mean my website. We will see what the cheapest hosting option is. As well as a domain 
    titled DasITGuy. The Guy for your IT needs. 
</p>
<h2 class="august14-19">August 14, 2019</h2>
<p>
    I have started to create a mock example of what the website will look like over at WebFlow. 
    This is present the findings of adding an IDX api to the client's website. 
    After this is viewed by said person, we will start the editing to get to the nit and gritty of
    the final product that will make the owner happy.
